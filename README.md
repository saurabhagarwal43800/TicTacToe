# TIC TAC TOE Project  

__Step1:__ Ask the user that he wants to play the game or not  
__Step2:__ Ask the user that he wants to be player1 or player2  
__Step3:__ It will show the player you chooses  
__Step4:__ It will show you the default board with numbers to recognise the position the player wants to move  
__Step5:__ Now it will ask the player to enter the number from 1-9 to make a move  
           If Player1 has the first chance it will make a move by 'X'  
           If Player2 has the first chance it will make a move by 'O'     
__Step6:__ If any player has the pattern matched to win the game first then it will be checked and the result is displayed      
           For example,if player1 won the game then it will show the message *"Congratulations Player1 won the game"*   
__Step7:__ After the game is finished it will ask the players that they want to play the game    
           If yes then the game again continues    
           else the game exits with the message *"Thank you for playing"*
