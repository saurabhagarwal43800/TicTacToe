__Step1:__ Ask the user that he wants to play the game or not  
__Step2:__ Ask the user that he wants to be player1 or player2  
__Step3:__ It will show the player you chooses  
__Step4:__ It will show you the default board with numbers to recognise the position the player wants to move  
__Step5:__ Now it will ask the player to enter the number from 1-9 to make a move  
           If Player1 has the first chance it will make a move by 'X'  
           If Player2 has the first chance it will make a move by 'O'
